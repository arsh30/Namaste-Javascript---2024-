UNDEFINED -> means we only declare the variable and dont put any value, so it is undefined,

            so var a = 7; // Even the line has executed, the JS engine read all the variables and put the value as undefined

            so var b; // It is also undefined because we just only declare the variable 


NOT DEFINED -> means we did not allocate the memory to the variable , or we can say we did not create the variable 
              thats why it is giving not defined 

              and also it is not present in the Global execution context 

-------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: JS is loosly typed language, because when we declare any variable , we can put any thing in the variable 

Ex: initially the variable is undefined then we update to string, 
and then also we update the same variable to Number, so the final 
value it is present is Number. 


2. Note: never do like this, var a = undefined;
so write like this -> var a; // It is also undefined
