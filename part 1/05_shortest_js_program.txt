->The Empty file is the shortest JS program, 

when we put the debugger in callStack(source) 
we see the the global execution is also created there, we don't have any variables
and when we write, window, it is created in global space, these function and variables are created by JS engine
and into the Global space,

and also, JS engine creates 'this' keyword, which points to window object at global level 

DEFINITION -> So whenever any JS prog is run, a global object is created(window in chrome , and in Node it is different), a global execution context is created and this is created
              thats why empty file is the shortes JS program

-----------------------------

Q) What is global Space / global level ?
Sol) anything code you write which is not inside the function;

Ex: 
var a = 10; // Global Space 
function a(){  // Global Space
  var x = 10; // Not in Global Space, because it is inside the function 
}

so the variables and function are attached to Global object (Window) 
so we can also access by [ window.a or a ] 
Note: it automatically assumes a ie in global space
